# Linear-Regression-FDA-Project
Using Linear Regression to predict wind turbine power output from wind speeds.

The objectives of this project are; 
1 Perform linear regression on the dataset.
2 Explain what this shows.
3 Predict wind speed power output from wind speed values.

I started by importing the dataset into my Jupyter Notebook.  Then I took a look at the datatypes, the dataset
itself and I plotted the 500 (x,y) values on a simple plot.  The plot seems to indicate that no power is produced at
very low or very high wind speeds.  The turbines start to produce power at 10 km/h approx and levels off producing peak 
power at about 18km/h.
